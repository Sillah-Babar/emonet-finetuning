# Estimation of Continuous Valence and Arousal Levels from Faces in Naturalistic Conditions

This project focuses on estimating **continuous valence and arousal (V–A) levels** from human facial expressions under naturalistic conditions.  
The workflow integrates **affective modeling**, **evaluation**, and a **real-time demonstration UI** built on top of *EmoNet* pretrained models.

## UI and Demo

A **real-time interactive demo** showcases valence–arousal estimation directly from webcam input. You can check a showcase video here: [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waxnplqpPgs)

**For demo details**, including setup instructions and usage guide, please refer to:  [`demo/README.md`](./demo/README.md)



## ⚙️ Requirements

A detailed list of dependencies and installation instructions will be included in each submodule’s README.
